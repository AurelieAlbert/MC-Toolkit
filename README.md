# MC-Toolkit
The goal of this repository is to give support materials for the meetings at IGE about tools: MC-Toolkit (MC stand for Mardi-Caf√©, Modelisation&Climate,... who knows?), in additions of a Slack channel. 

Here are some ideas of topics/tools to talk about:
- xarray (+dask) / cdo / climaf (climatology)
- How to compute climatologies (DJF, days in months, etc. what do you do?)
- cartopy / ferret / basemap / proplot (plot)
- regrid (cdo, basemap, scipy/stats, xESMF)
- Jupiter Notebook / Anaconda
- Computation centers (CIMENT, CICLAD, etc?)
- Machine Learning
- How to make a poster?
- Statistics (how to compute trends, etc.?) 
- How to write an article / deal with bibliography? (latex, medeley, overleaf, etc.)
- Linux basics (bash, commands)
- How to get CMIP6 data? (website, CICLAD/CLIMAF)
- Reanalyses / Observations 
- How to launch MAR / LMDZ / Elmer-ICE / NEMO
  
The goal is to present a tool and exchange with others + know who to ask when we need help.
