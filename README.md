# MC-Toolkit
The goal of this repository is to give support materials for the meetings at [IGE](http://www.ige-grenoble.fr/) about tools: MC-Toolkit (MC stand for Mardi-Café, Modelisation&Climate,... who knows?), in additions of a Slack channel.

For easily editing a README: [https://stackedit.io/](https://stackedit.io/)

## Next meetings:
- Tuesday 16/06 at 09:30 am: **Cartopy map** (Fanny Brun)

## Possible meetings:

- basics of **xarray** (Mickaël Lalande)
- **dask+xarray** and **pangeo** (Aurélie Albert)
- **visit** / **FlowVR** (Basile HECTOR)
- **PyVista** (Benoït Urruty)

## Past meetings:

- Tuesday 05/05 at 10:30 am: ['best practices' with **git**+**jupyter notebooks**](https://github.com/mickaellalande/MC-Toolkit/blob/master/Best-practices-notebooks-conda-git/README.md) (Aurélie Albert)

## Here are some ideas of topics/tools to talk about:
- xarray (+dask) / cdo / climaf (climatology)  
- How to compute climatologies (DJF, days in months, etc. what do you do?)
- cartopy / ferret / basemap / proplot (plot)  
- regrid (cdo, basemap, scipy/stats, xESMF)  
- Jupiter Notebook / Anaconda
- Computation centers (CIMENT, CICLAD, etc?)
- Machine Learning
- How to make a poster?
- Statistics (how to compute trends, etc.?) 
- How to write an article / deal with bibliography? (latex, medeley, overleaf, etc.)  
- Linux basics (bash, commands)
- How to get CMIP6 data? (website, CICLAD/CLIMAF)
- Reanalyses / Observations 
- How to launch MAR / LMDZ / Elmer-ICE / NEMO

  
The goal is to present a tool and exchange with others + know who to ask when we need help.

[MEOM's tutos software](https://github.com/meom-group/tutos/blob/master/software.md) already has a lot a useful informations!
